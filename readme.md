# Water Logging 

 # Xcode Version 12.0 beta (12A6159)
 # iOS Deployment Target : 13.4
 
 # Enhancement:
 Calculate water intake goal based on user's weight (read from HealthKit). This
goal and progress should update when user's weight updates.

Firstly, I choose this enhancement because this allowed me to leverage the amazing tools developed by the HealthKit team to read the user's body mass and calculate the water intake requirement dynamically.
Secondly, as this opportunity is closely related to the clinical health team, I wanted to familiarize myself with all HealthKit tools and documentation required to help the clinical health team.
